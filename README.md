# Data Engineer Portfolio

Hello, I’m Alexandre! I’m thrilled to present my evolving portfolio as a data engineer. This repository showcases a diverse collection of projects I’ve completed, ranging from coursework in data analytics/engineering to self-initiated exercises. Each project reflects essential skills and techniques.

## [Web Scraping - Beautiful Soup](https://github.com/Zandersan/Beautiful-Soup)
* **Overview**: Scraped data from Berlin’s official website using Beautiful Soup, created a dataset with restaurant information, and visualized it in an interactive map on Tableau Public.
* **Technologies**: Python, Beautiful Soup, pandas
* **Outcome**: Interactive map visualizing restaurants in Berlin.

## [Apache Airflow - Dataflow Pipeline](https://github.com/Zandersan/Dataflow-Pipelines)
* **Overview**: Utilized Apache Beam to perform ETL operations on a BigQuery dataset (bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire), extracting detailed data about London bicycles to analyze cycling behaviors. The goal was to calculate the number of rides between stations and output the results as a text file (start_id, end_id, number_of_rides).
* **Technologies**: Python, Apache Beam, GCP, Google Cloud SDK Shell
* **Outcome**: Text file with ETL results.

## [Apache Spark - Similar Movies Finder](https://github.com/Zandersan/Apache-Spark)
* **Overview**: Processed large-scale data using Apache Spark on an EMR cluster hosted on AWS. Analyzed 27 million movie ratings for 58,000 movies provided by 280,000 users to find the most similar movies to a selected one.
* **Technologies**: AWS (EMR on EC2, S3), Apache Spark, PySpark, Python
* **Outcome**: Top 10 most similar movies to "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope."

## [Apache Kafka - Stock Market Simulation](https://github.com/Zandersan/Apache-Kafka)
* **Overview**: Implemented Apache Kafka to simulate real-time data streaming. 
* **Technologies**: AWS (EC2, S3, Crawler, Amazon Athena), Python
* **Outcome**: Continuous data uploads to an S3 bucket during the simulation.

## [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://github.com/Zandersan/GCP-Case-Study)
* **Overview**: Completed a case study as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate program.
* **Methodology**: Data preprocessing, cleaning, analysis, visualization, drawing conclusions, and creating a strategy proposal.
* **Technologies**: Python, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn
* **Outcome**: Comprehensive analysis and visualizations.
